# Stock Seller üí∏

This is a CLI that helps me make "portfolio rebalancing" decisions.

This program is based on a piece of advice I heard

> Sell 20% of your shares in a stock after a __40% increase__ in price. <br />
> After another 40% increase, sell another 20%. <br />
> And so on......

I made the first calculation by hand for my shares in [CSTM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CSTM?p=CSTM&.tsrc=fin-srch) and decided to automate the process.

Here's a short video üëáüèΩ
